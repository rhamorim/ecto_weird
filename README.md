# EctoWeird

## Note:

This repository was created to show a weird behavior with ecto and nested embedded schemas. Just run the server, navigate to http://localhost:4000/weird ,
and submit the form. Code is entirely on the lib/ecto_weird_web/live/weird_live.ex file.

## Back to before:

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
